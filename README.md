Android mumble client

This is a fork of a Android Mumble client created by @pcgod. It has been repurposed as a library to be used with
RevUnit/overwatch-android. The services has been modified to connect securely using SSL certificates. 

None of the Activities are used. Only the service and its dependencies are utilized in overwatch-android.
